# CityGML Dynamizer module (Schema)

`ogc.geo.citygml.dynamizer` *v3.0.0*

The Dynamizer module supports the injection of timeseries data for individual attributes of CityGML features. Timeseries data can either be retrieved from external Sensor APIs (e.g. OGC SensorThings API, OGC Sensor Observation Services, MQTT, proprietary platforms), external standardized timeseries files (e.g. OGC TimeseriesML or OGC Observations & Measurements), external tabulated files (e.g CSV) or can be represented inline as basic time-value pairs.
